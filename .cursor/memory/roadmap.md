# Project Roadmap

## Vision
Hybrid Archon system that balances speed (Fast Lane) with depth (Slow Lane) using a 4-file memory system.

## Current Phase
**Phase:** Active Development
**Status:** In Progress
**Date:** 2026-02-01

## Milestones

### Phase 1: System Initialization
- [x] Create memory directory structure
- [x] Initialize 4 memory files
- [x] Create orchestrator rule file
- [x] Set up Hybrid Archon routing system

### Phase 2: Active Development
- [x] First Fast Lane task execution
- [ ] First Slow Lane task execution
- [x] Memory system validation

## Technical Debt
- None identified yet

## Future Enhancements
- Monitor memory file sizes and optimize as needed
- Refine classification logic based on experience
- Improve parallel execution safety checks

## Progress Tracking
- Memory system: Initialized
- Orchestrator: Active
- Skills integration: Ready

## Notes
- Update this file when milestones are reached
- Track technical debt and future enhancements
- Maintain project vision alignment
