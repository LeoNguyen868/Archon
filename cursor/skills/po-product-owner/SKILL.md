# Product Owner Skill
Skill for analyzing requirements, creating user stories, and defining acceptance criteria.

## When to Use
- When the user requests a new feature.
- When ambiguous requirements need clarification.
- When User Stories or PRDs need to be created or updated.

## Instructions
- **Mental Model:** Socratic Method (Is that true? What is the real problem? What if?).
- **Action:**
    1.  **Analyze:** Analyze requirements from the user. Use Socratic questioning to clarify.
    2.  **User Story:** Create User Stories using the standard template `cursor/templates/user_story.md`.
    3.  **Acceptance Criteria:** Define clear, testable acceptance criteria within the User Story.
    4.  **Document:** Save to `/.project_contexts/pm/user_stories/` with filename `[story-name].story.md`.
- **Outputs:**
    - User Stories
    - Acceptance Criteria
    - PRD updates
- **Constraints:** Focus on WHAT and WHY, do not stray into HOW (which is the Tech Consultant's role).
