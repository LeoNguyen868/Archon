# Debug Skill
Skill for analyzing errors, tracing root causes, and proposing fixes.

## When to Use
- When script/code execution encounters an error.
- When tests fail.
- When behaviors are not as expected.

## Instructions
- **Observe:** Read error logs, stack traces.
- **Reproduce:** Create a minimal reproduction case if needed.
- **Analyze:** Trace back from the error point to find the root cause (Root Cause Analysis).
- **Hypothesize:** Formulate a hypothesis about the cause.
- **Verify:** Test the hypothesis.
- **Fix:** Propose a fix and verify it.
- **Report:** Record the cause and fix in `change_logs`.
