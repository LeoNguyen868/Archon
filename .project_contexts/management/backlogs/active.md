# Active Implementation Ticket: DOC-001

**Status:** IN_PROGRESS
**Assignee:** planning-worker
**Created:** 2026-01-29

## Context
First task in comprehensive project documentation initiative. Need to analyze the complete Archon codebase to understand current structure, identify undocumented components, and create documentation inventory for the open source project.

## Requirements
- [ ] Analyze complete project structure and codebase
- [ ] Identify undocumented components and architecture patterns
- [ ] Map skills to documentation requirements
- [ ] Catalog existing documentation gaps
- [ ] Create documentation inventory matrix

## Technical Notes
- Focus on skills/, agents/, and core architecture files
- Identify OODA loop implementation points across the codebase
- Map worker orchestration patterns and delegation mechanisms
- Document context management system and project contexts structure
- Analyze skills categorization (High-Level, Technical, General)
- Review existing documentation in docs/ and README.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete codebase inventory created
- [ ] Documentation gaps identified and prioritized
- [ ] Skills-to-documentation mapping completed
- [ ] OODA loop implementation points documented
- [ ] Worker system patterns analyzed
- [ ] Context management system understood

## Plan
1. Review project structure and key directories
2. Analyze skills implementation and categorization
3. Map OODA loop integration points
4. Document worker orchestration patterns
5. Identify documentation gaps
6. Create inventory matrix for next steps
